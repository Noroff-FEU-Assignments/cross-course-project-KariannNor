My first home page is made. It's not optimal and not what i would've liked it to look like. However i'm in a learning state and making progress with code. 

My header is not containing the hamburger-icon, only because of time issues. Unfortunately. It's responsive. Have had some strugles with the font being displayed properly and some navigational issues.
